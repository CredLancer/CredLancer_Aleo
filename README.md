CredLancer: On-chain Credentials & Collaboration

# Project Description
CredLancer aims to deliver tamper-proof credentials, showcase professional development and achievement, while maintaining data privacy and sovereignty. We aim to address three major problems:
- The lack of trust and verifiability in professional credentials
- Difficulty in demonstrating professional development and achievements
- Lack of interoperability and portability of professional data
  
CredLancer enables organizations to issue tamper-proof credentials to employees and other members, and allows professionals to showcase these on-chain credentials along with their professional development certifications. With the integration of Zero-Knowledge Proofs, CredLancer ensures that personal data remains private while still allowing for verifiable validation of professional qualifications.

The Anonymous Rating Survey system implemented in the project allows employers and freelancers to privately rate each other based on criteria such as quality, communication, and speed, ensuring anonymity and fostering accurate assessments without disclosing individual rating histories.

# Importance of Privacy
Onboarding or Vetting System
Secure personal identification verification like passport, license 
Secure personal documents verification like university degrees (keeping folks undoxxed)  
Secure location or tax jurisdiction verification documents 
Payment System
Private payments are secured in escrow to ensure each project is backed by funds while not revealing to the entire platform the on-chain record of payment details. SuperLancers should have their earning amounts private. Employees should have specific amount details private to keep their competitive edge when proposing budgets. 
History of payment shall be revealed to system in order to allow private rating system (only projects & freelancers that have works together can issue rating tokens)  

# Collaboration System
Anonymous Rating Tokens, modernized version of anonymous surveys. Their purpose is to ensure accountability and collaboration among the employees and freelancers utilizing the platform for project collaboration.
